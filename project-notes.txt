ColorsInteract
=========================

- Small-ish board.
- Bunch of shapes that are colors. They can move around but not off of the board.
- When they overlap they become less opaque so you can see the mix of colors in the overlapping region
- start with squares but want to be able to put other shapes in too.
- Server should just manage the game-state between the clients.
- Clients should handle all of the drawing. 
- Clents only react to new info from the server. E.G. I move, don't move immediately, wait for info to come from server.  



Phase One
=========================
- Get multiple clients receiving information from eachother in real time (via the server)
  - Probably just text for now
