ColorsInteract
=========================

- Small-ish board.
- Bunch of shapes that are colors. They can move around but not off of the board.
- When they overlap they become less opaque so you can see the mix of colors in the overlapping region
- start with squares but want to be able to put other shapes in too.
- Server should just manage the game-state between the clients.
- Clients should handle all of the drawing. 
- Clents only react to new info from the server. E.G. I move, don't move immediately, wait for info to come from server.  



Phase One
=========================
- Get multiple clients receiving information from eachother in real time (via the server)
  - Probably just text for now

Phase Two
=========================
- Lay out game state communication rules
  - Server needs to have all the current game state info to give to new clients
  - Start with server just marking game-state as dirty, telling all the clients "hey, I have new stuff. so scrap everything you had and rebuild using this new info"
    - Probably do that with a game-state timestamp and just check on the client for newer stuff
  - Not really a good way to share types between the server and the client so I'll have that seperate. Have the server stuff focus on values not operations.
  - Get the clients/server communicating gamestate changes. No actual client drawing yet.
